Reasoning models
Explore advanced reasoning and problem-solving models.
Reasoning models, like OpenAI o1 and o3-mini, are new large language models trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. Reasoning models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning for agentic workflows.

As with our GPT models, we provide both a smaller, faster model (o3-mini) that is less expensive per token, and a larger model (o1) that is somewhat slower and more expensive, but can often generate better responses for complex tasks, and generalize better across domains.

Quickstart
Reasoning models can be used through the chat completions endpoint as seen here.

note there is no system prompt in the o-series models

Using a reasoning model in chat completions
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with 
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o3-mini",
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": prompt
        }
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
